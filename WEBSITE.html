	  <img src="youth22.png">
	<p>Based on the purpose of our channel which is to promote our events for communities like Sitio Bebe. We have concluded that our target audience for our channel should be adults or working class fit to donate. The gender or sexuality generally do not matter as we fully support each of them the same way. Taking in to consideration the people's ages that are willing to donate, the age could be varied but will be within 18-24. This is because many older people do not use youtube as much as younger people do in the Philippines18-24 years old has a percentage of 86% while 55 and above has 14% usage of the internet. We also chose this age range because they are usually people who can go to concerts or events. In conclusion, We chose specifically youth donors as our target audience based on the information we have gotten and the content we will make on this channel.</p>

	<h1>PROJECT SITIO BEBE</h1>
	<h2>PROBELMS IN SITIO BEBE</h2>
		<h4>Health problems</h4>
		  <p>The Health Issues that are surrounding the community:</p>
				<h5>1. Acute Respiratory Infection</h5>
				  <p>-Is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. This infection can affect both your upper and lower respiratory system. They are divided into 2 types depending on the location whcih are upper and lower respiratory infections. It is the most frequently caused by respiratory syncytial virus , rhinovirus, influenza, and more. It's symptoms include congestion, runny nose , cough , sore throat and more.</p>
				<h5>2. Hypertension</h5>
				  <p>-Is blood presssure that is higher than normal where your body arteries are affaected. These play a role in getting this disease: smoking , lack of physical activity, family history and heat. Symptoms of this disease are headaches, shortness of breath and nosebleeds.</p>
				<h5>3. Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infection</h5>
			  	<p>-An infection that affects the airways, such as with bronchitis or air sacs at the end of the airways.Caused by bronchiolitis and pnemonia whcih is then caused by viruses , bacterias and fungi. Symptoms include a stuffed up or unny nose, a dry cough , a low or high fever , a mild sore throat and a dull headache.</p>
		<h4>Factors that caused the problem</h4>
		  <p>The factors that contributed to the health crisis in Sitio Bebe are the consumption of well water, covid , hot temperature, lack of water supply , mining and shortage of health professionals. Well water is a contributor to the health crisis as in Sitio Bebe they take water from a well and through boiling it kills the bacteria , viruses and parasites in the well water. However when not boiled enough it can be dangerous as it can deteriote our helth. Non filtered water or simply water that is not boiled enough can leave water impurities and dangerous contaminants such as chlorine, disinfection byproduct and heavy metals. It is a risk factor of Acute Respiratory Infection within the people from Sitio Bebe because it increases the chance of getting this disease as it weakens our lungs allowing it to attck.<br>Covid is als a contributor to the problems as it made the problem worse as they could no longer focus solely on the health crisis that is happening in their town. Most importantly Covid also contributed to the factors that can increase the likelihood of having pnemonia. The hot temperature and the lack of water supply is a risk factor of the people's high blood pressure or hypertension through having too much stress. Because of the shortage in health professionsals they were not able to reducs the number and stop the uncontrollable spread of the diseases.</p>
	<h4>Number of cases recorded in Sitio Bebe Compared to Central Luzon</h4>
	  <div class="data close activ3" id="close">
			<img src="analysis.png">
		</div>
		<div class="data openn" id="openn">
			<img src="data22.png">
		</div>
		<h4>Click the table to see the graph !</h4>
		<p>In order to understand the sevirity of this health Issue we must compare it with a community that has the same characteristics.<br><br>From the data that can be seen both in the graph and in the table, We are able to interprest the comparison of the highest and the lowest percentage cases of the disease between Sitio Bebe and Central Luzon. According to the data seen above the disease cases which are acute respiratory infections , acure respiratory tract infections and hypertensions are higher in Sitio Bebe compared to Central luzon. From that we are able to infer that these diseases are caused by something that exists in both Central Luzon and in Sitio Bebe. By investigating what these 2 have in common that produce the same diseases, We have concluded both of tehir characteristics that have caused this which are heat , water shortage and mining. The temperature is a risk factor of the rise of hypertension because the body attempts to radiate heat. </p>
	<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
	  <p>To lessen the chance of developing these diseases we must have a healthy repiratory system and to do that we need to practice a healthy lifestyle. To have a healthy lifestyle you first need to know what to avoid, meaning avoiding the causes of these diseases.<br><br>Water shortage and heta is a risk factor in trigeering this disease especisally in the case of Sitio Bebe where they experience frequent droughts from their lack of water supply and summer temperature. Another contributor to hypertension is air pollution in which factories create, that can expose chemical fumes to the workers as well as to the public. This goes to the miners as well as they too are exposed to air pollutants though it only affects them. To avoid getting hypertension we need to drink plenty of fluids to stay hysdrated within the burning temperature of Sitio Bebe, Have a healthy mental state , avoid midday heat or places that are hotter than usual, Healthy dieat and apply sunscreen if outdoors and most importantly stay at home.<br><br>From what we know acute respiratory lower respiratory tract infection like bronchitis is caused by exposure to chemical fumes such as dust in the mines and exposure to chemicals in factories. Which means they should refrain from going to the mines as often and they should wear masks if they do go in. Another acute respiratory tract infection is caused by pnemonia which is, in the case of Sitio Bebe, caused by covid and chemical fumes in the atmosphere. Drinking non boiled or not properly boiled well water is a risk factor to this as it weakens our lungs allowing diseases like these to enter our body. As they cannot avoid drinking well water as it is their only source of water supply we need to make sure it is boiled proplerly as well as save the environment to lessen the chemical fumes in the atmosphere.<br><br>Diseases like the common cold, epiglottis , strep throat and sinusitus are all caused by 2 things which are exposure to covid19  which can easily be fixed through following the Covid guidelines and the summer heat which can also be avoided through the same activities with the hypertension like don't go outside ,drink plenty of fluid and more.<br><br>Aside from avoiding teh causes of these diseases we also have to keep in mind these repiratory diseases are infectious which means they can be transferred from person to person. So, it would do nothing if you avoid the causes but still interact with people without the following protocols. To prevent acute repsiratory we need to wash frequently , always cover when sneezing to avoid spreading the disease and avoid touching ones face to prevent germs from entering our system.<br><br>As An event organizer we can help the community of Sitio Bebe by starting or planning a fundraiser event for them through a concert in which we will raise funds to then help Sitio Bebe. Since concerts are done for many reasons but it has one purpose to raise funds/money. It is the perfect fundraising event as people will likely come to the concert to entertain themselves while helping the community. To raise it's chances of getting many attendees we will promote it through our youtube channel which will increase the chance of succeding in earning the target profit as through that we can reach our target audience.</p>
	<h2>CONCERT PLANNING</h2>
		<p>In the video below, We will explain the procedures of the preconcert preparations which is before the concert that will include the things needed for the concert and actions to prepare for each items in the list. We will also discuss concert proper where we will narrate the procedures during the concerta nd finally the pre concert tasks whcih will narrate the procedures after the post activity wherein we will talk about the things they need to do to distribute the proceeds to the people of Sitio Bebe. </p>
